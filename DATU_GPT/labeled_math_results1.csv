So, the derivative of 2ln(x) is:

2 * (1/x) = 2/x

And the derivative of e^x is:

e^x

Adding them together, we get:

2/x + e^x

Now, to evaluate this at x=1, we simply substitute 1 for x:

2/1 + e^1 = 2 + e

Therefore, the derivative of 2ln(x) + e^x evaluated at x=1 is 2+e."
73,What is the value of sin(pi/6)?,The value of sin(pi/6) is 0.5.,The value of sin(pi/6) is 1/2.
74,What is the value of 50 - 4 * 3^2 + 7?,"To calculate the value of 50 - 4 * 3^2 + 7, first evaluate the expression 3^2: 3^2 = [9]. Then, multiply 3^2 by 4: 4 * 3^2 = [36]. Next, subtract 4 * 3^2 from 50: 50 - 4 * 3^2 = [14]. Finally, add 7 to 50 - 4 * 3^2: 50 - 4 * 3^2 + 7 = [21]. So, 50 - 4 * 3^2 + 7 = 27.","To solve the expression, we need to follow the order of operations which is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). 

Using this order, we have:

50 - 4 * 3^2 + 7 

= 50 - 4 * 9 + 7     (since 3^2 = 9)

= 50 - 36 + 7        (since 4 * 9 = 36)

= 21

Therefore, the value of the expression 50 - 4 * 3^2 + 7 is 21."
