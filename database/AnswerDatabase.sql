These plants have adapted to grow in soils with a low pH and require specific nutrients, such as iron, manganese, and zinc, which are less available in alkaline soils. \n\nThe way these plants take up cations is by releasing hydrogen ions (H+) into the soil. This process, called acidification, increases the availability of certain nutrients that are essential for the growth of these plants. However, this also reduces the availability of other nutrients, such as calcium and magnesium, which are more available in alkaline soils. \n\nTherefore, the growth of ericaceous plants can have both positive and negative effects on their surroundings. On the one hand, they can improve the availability of certain nutrients in acidic soils, making it easier for other acid-loving plants to grow. On the other hand, they may compete with other plants for certain nutrients, which can limit their growth.
